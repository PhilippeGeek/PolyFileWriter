{"name":"PolyFileWriter","tagline":"HTML5 Polyfills for FileAPI Writer support by a Java Applet","body":"# Usage\r\nTo implement PolyFileWriter on your own site, you have to do many things:\r\n\r\n* Edit the security checker in `org.javascool.polyfilewriter.Gateway`\r\n   In the function `init()` change the code to :\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif(!getCodeBase().getHost().equals(\"example.com\")){\r\n            appletLocked=true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n   Don't forget to replace `example.com` by your own website\r\n\r\n* Compile the jar (An big step):\r\n    To create the jar for the library, use the Makefile (use Cygwin on Windows).\r\n    You have to put some environment varaibles:\r\n    * JDK_HOME : The root of your JDK instalation (not bin folder, the root)\r\n    * jvs_sign_key: The keystore's key used to sign the applet\r\n    * project_home: The path to this GIT repo (set empty if it's PWD)\r\n    * user_tmp_nav: Used to create a profile for chromium (test enterpoint)\r\n    To build the jar and sign it, execute :\r\n    ```make signedjar```\r\nbe sure that polyfilewriter.jar is in PolyFileWriter-JQuery.\r\n\r\n* Add libs to your HTML page :\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"jquery.polyfilewriter.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n    Copy jquery.polyfilewriter.js and polyfilewriter.jar beside your html file\r\n\r\n* Run the plugin :\r\n```js\r\n$(document).ready(function(){\r\n    $.polyfilewriter({\r\n            jar:\"polyfilewriter.jar\", // Location of the JAR (If you don't write it the default location will be polyfilewriter.jar)\r\n            id:\"PolyFileWriter\" // The applet id (If you don't write it the default location will be a random UUID)\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Code\r\nThe code has got tow sides, one part is written in Java and the other as a jQuery plugin.\r\n\r\nFor the part in Java, there is two class :\r\n\r\n* org.javascool.tools.FileManager: A file access class written for Java's Cool 4\r\n* org.javascool.polyfilewriter: An applet class to talk with JavaScript\r\n\r\nFor the JS part, it's a simple JQuery extension\r\n\r\n# Security Warning\r\nOpen the user file system to the web can cause many security problem, so this library is originaly written to run on Java's Cool environment (http://www.javascool.fr) and make stuff to check if it's into.\r\nHowever, you can fork the project, rewrite security checks into the Applet class, recompile and sign (With your own certificate) the final jar.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
